## TODO

- [ ] Describe the ai-facade responsibilities and public interfaces for other modules.
- [ ] List supported client libraries: `@google-cloud/aiplatform`, `@google-cloud/vertexai`, `@google/genai`, and recommended versions.
- [ ] Provide deployment checklist: service account creation, IAM roles, Secret Manager / env var configuration.
- [ ] Define error-handling, validation, and sanitization patterns for AI responses.
- [ ] Add sample usage snippets (Cloud Function invocation examples) and testing guidance.

Security reminder: never include API keys or service-account JSON in repo. Use Secret Manager or environment configuration in Cloud Functions.
