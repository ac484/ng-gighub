// NOTE: Project prefers standalone components and `inject()` over NgModules.
// This file is a lightweight shared helper module for the ai-facade blueprint
// and intentionally does NOT register an Angular NgModule. It exports
// shared utilities, types, and factory functions used by adapters/orchestrators.

export const shared = {
  // Example shared helper placeholder
  name: 'ai-facade-shared'
};

// Replace with actual exports (helpers, tokens, factories) as needed.
