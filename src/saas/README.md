Quick notes for AI-driven code generation

- Use the `src/saas/TODO_TEMPLATE.md` as the canonical checklist when generating `DESIGN.md` / `README.md` for subfolders.
- For each facade: provide full TypeScript interfaces for inputs/outputs, example JSON payloads, enumerated error codes, and at least one acceptance-test description.
- Label backend-only operations explicitly (they must be implemented in Cloud Functions and called via repository/cloud function clients).
