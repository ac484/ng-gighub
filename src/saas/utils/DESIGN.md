# utils — DESIGN

Purpose
- Small, well-typed helper functions and utilities shared across saas modules (date formatting, validation, small adapters).

Public API
- Export named functions with clear inputs/outputs and unit tests.

Testing
- Each utility must have unit tests and clear edge-case coverage.

TODO
- Add `utils/index.ts` barrel and document each exported helper.
