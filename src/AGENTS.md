# Source Directory – AGENTS.md

This document defines **how AI coding agents must treat the `src/` directory**.  
It describes **responsibilities, boundaries, and forbidden actions**.

This is **not** a tutorial.

---

## 1. Directory Purpose

The `src/` directory is the **root of all application source code**.

It contains:
- Application bootstrap and runtime entry
- Angular application code
- Global styles and assets
- Environment configuration
- Global TypeScript definitions

No business logic should exist outside `src/app/`.

---

## 2. Directory Structure

src/ ├── AGENTS.md                    # This file ├── main.ts                      # Application bootstrap entry ├── index.html                   # HTML entry point ├── typings.d.ts                 # Global type definitions ├── style-icons.ts               # Manual icon registry ├── style-icons-auto.ts          # Auto-generated icon registry ├── styles.less                  # Global stylesheet entry ├── app/                         # Angular application source (AGENTS.md) ├── assets/                      # Static assets ├── environments/                # Environment configs (AGENTS.md) └── styles/                      # Global styles & themes (AGENTS.md)

---

## 3. Key File Rules

### 3.1 main.ts

**Purpose**: Application bootstrap only.

**Rules**
- MUST be the **single** application entry point
- MUST use `bootstrapApplication()`
- MUST bootstrap `AppComponent` with `appConfig`
- MUST handle bootstrap errors
- MUST NOT contain business logic
- MUST NOT contain feature imports

---

### 3.2 index.html

**Purpose**: HTML shell only.

**Rules**
- MUST include `<app-root>`
- MUST include required meta tags
- MUST include favicon reference
- MUST remain framework-agnostic
- MUST NOT include application logic

---

### 3.3 typings.d.ts

**Purpose**: Global TypeScript declarations.

**Rules**
- MAY declare global interfaces or types
- MAY extend third-party library typings
- MUST avoid naming collisions with application models
- MUST NOT contain domain or business types

---

### 3.4 style-icons.ts

**Purpose**: Explicit icon registration.

**Rules**
- MUST define icons used by the application
- MUST export icon definitions for ng-alain
- MUST remain in sync with `style-icons-auto.ts`
- MUST NOT include application logic

---

### 3.5 style-icons-auto.ts

**Purpose**: Auto-generated icon registry.

**Rules**
- MUST NOT be manually edited
- MAY be regenerated by tooling
- MUST be treated as read-only

---

### 3.6 styles.less

**Purpose**: Global style entry point.

**Rules**
- MUST import global theme and style definitions
- MUST NOT contain component-specific styles
- MUST NOT include business-related selectors

---

## 4. Subdirectory Responsibilities

### app/

- Contains **all Angular application logic**
- Feature behavior, state, and domain rules live here
- Governed by `src/app/AGENTS.md`

---

### assets/

- Static files only (images, fonts, icons)
- No scripts, logic, or configuration
- Must be safe for CDN delivery

---

### environments/

- Environment-specific configuration only
- No secrets, no runtime logic
- Governed by `src/environments/AGENTS.md`

---

### styles/

- Global styles, themes, variables
- No component or feature logic
- Governed by `src/styles/AGENTS.md`

---

## 5. Global Rules for `src/`

**Rules**
1. All business logic MUST live under `src/app/`
2. No feature logic is allowed at `src/` root
3. Bootstrap files MUST remain minimal and declarative
4. Global styles MUST NOT leak business intent
5. Environment files MUST NOT contain logic
6. TypeScript strict mode MUST be respected
7. Angular project structure MUST remain conventional

---

## 6. AI Agent Constraints

### Forbidden Actions

- Adding business logic outside `src/app/`
- Importing feature code into `main.ts`
- Modifying auto-generated files manually
- Introducing runtime logic into `index.html`
- Placing domain models in `typings.d.ts`

---

### Required Behavior

- Treat `src/` as infrastructure, not domain
- Defer all feature decisions to `app/`
- Preserve bootstrap simplicity
- Respect subdirectory AGENTS.md boundaries
